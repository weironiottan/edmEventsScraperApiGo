    <h1>EDM Events API Server</h1>
    <p>Welcome to the EDM Events API Server!! </p>
    <h2>About The Project</h2>
    <p>This Go API server scrapes clubs in Vegas that host edm events. I personally love EDM and I live close enough to Vegas to be able
        see the different shows year round.  There was one problem though, it is really hard to find out what club in Vegas plays which  DJ.
        As an example I really like Martin Garrix however I didn't know he was playing at a certain date in Vegas. It was not on his website,
        neither on any of the other aggregate EDM Las Vegas Websites. I even tried a couple of APIs such as ticket master or bands in town.
        Nothing consistently found all the events a DJ would play in Vegas, unless I physically visited all the different casino club websites</p>
    <p>There had to be a better way. So basically I created scripts to scrape each of the club websites using Cheerio. I then collected all the relevant
        info and sent it over to mongoDB, and then automatically re-check the websites every 24 hrs. I then created different API endpoints listed in the docs
        in order to filter based on the different info needed for a potential website.</p>
    <p>Currently the API collects info from the following clubs:
        AYU Nights/Day, Zouk, XS, Omnia, Hakassan, Marquee, Wet Republic, Encore Beach Night/Day, Jewel, Liquid Pool Lounge </p>
    <p>A current version of this server is deployed on a heroku app and you are more then welcome to access it and use it for any purpose. As of now
        I don't have any restrictions for the API, meaning there are no API Keys needed just the url and the  right API Endpoint. This might change in the
        future if there are too many requests and I run out of the free allotment on Heroku. However you could literally fork this project and deploy it to
        Railway(This is where this currently hosted) and have your own custom server. The only thing I request is that you give credit where credit is due :)</p>
